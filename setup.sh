# This script assumes the student's repo has been cloned manually. The student 
# should have logged onto GitLabg, found their repo and cloned it. During that process,
# any issues with credentials would have been resolved.

# The script will then prompt the user for name, email, cohort and bitbucket team before configuring
# their diff tool settings and setting the upstream repository.
