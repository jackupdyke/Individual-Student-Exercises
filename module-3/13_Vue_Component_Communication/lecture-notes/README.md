# Component Communication

## Overview of Session

In this lecture, you'll continue working with the product reviews application. The first part of the lecture is a discussion around taking the monolithic `ProductReview.vue` component and breaking it down into multiple components.

The second part of the lecture is focused on adding Vuex data retrieval (`state`) and modifications (`mutations`) to pre-created single-responsibility components. The third part of the lecture is focused on creating a new component.

## Session Objectives

- Identify candidate components in a web page/application
- Explain the "Single Responsibility Principle"
- Implement a simple SPA that utilizes components that work together
- Implement a "child" component that's passed data from the parent using `props`
- Create child components from an array in a parent component
- Access data stored in Vuex from multiple components
- Modify data stored in Vuex using "mutations"
